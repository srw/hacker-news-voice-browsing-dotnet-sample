Prerequisites:
If you use our code you will just need Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. However if there is a new version of boilerpipe you will have to generate the boilerpipe .NET assemblies yourself as follows:

- Have Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
- Download boilerpipe from http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/
- Download and install IKVM from http://www.ikvm.net/
- Run boilerpipe library and dependencies through ikvmc: ikvmc -nojni -target:library  boilerpipe-1.2.0.jar lib\nekohtml-1.9.13.jar lib\xerces-2.9.1.jar
- Use the resulting boilerpipe-1.2.0.dll .NET assembly from ikvmc.
